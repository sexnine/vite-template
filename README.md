## Install

`npm i`

## Side note:
If you run into this shitass error
```
listen EACCES: permission denied 0.0.0.0:3000
```
It's probably docker eating up all your ports (bro i kid you not docker took up every port jetbrains tried to bind to and couldnt open up my mfing ide) and it's probably time to restart your computer lol

To fix - run in powershell administator:
```
net stop winnat
net start winnat
```
